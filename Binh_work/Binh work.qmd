Some preliminary work on the data: importing datasets and stuff like that.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(stargazer)
```

```{r, echo=F}
# Actually reading the csvs
census <- read_csv("hh census tracts.csv")
regions <- read_csv("hh regions.csv")
cities <- read_csv("hh cities.csv")
zipcodes <- read_csv("hh zipcodes.csv")
counties <- read_csv("hh counties.csv")

```
